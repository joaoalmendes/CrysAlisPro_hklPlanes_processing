In order to acess the could disk where the data is stored and copy it and/or process and use it
we need to proceed in the following manner:

- Turn on the university VPN 

- 'cd' command and 'cd /mnt' to acess the various disks in the windows system

- To mount in a certain directory, 'Z:' for example, we run 'sudo mount -t drvfs Z: /mnt/z'

Note: Care that every time you disconnect from the VPN you will need to mount the Z: drive again
